<p style="text-align: center;">Everyone makes one mistake<br />
One more time for old times sake<br />
One more time before the feeling fades</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">One that’s born of memories<br />
One more bruise you gave to me<br />
One more test just how much can I take</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Because you’re not the one but you’re the only one<br />
Who can make me feel like this<br />
You’re not the one but you’re the only one<br />
Who can make me feel like shit</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Something never meant to be<br />
Everything you meant to me<br />
Wake me when this punishment is done</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Those who try and get away<br />
From the one who gets away<br />
Someone’s always someone else’s one</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Because you’re not the one but you’re the only one<br />
Who can make me feel like this<br />
You’re not the one but you’re the only one<br />
Who can make me feel like shit<br />
You’re not the one but you’re the only one<br />
Who can make me feel like this<br />
You’re not the one but you’re the only one<br />
Who can make me feel like shit</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Until the end of time<br />
In another life<br />
Until the day I die<br />
Save it up for one more try<br />
Save it for the last goodbye<br />
We go on and get off<br />
And get on and get off</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Because you’re not the one but you’re the only one<br />
Who can make me feel like this<br />
You’re not the one but you’re the only one<br />
Who can make me feel like shit<br />
You’re not the one but you’re the only one<br />
Who can make me feel like this<br />
You’re not the one but you’re the only one<br />
Who can make me feel like shit</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Because you’re not the one but you’re the only one<br />
Who can make me feel like this<br />
You’re not the one but you’re the only one<br />
Who can make me feel like<br />
Ohhhhhhhhh shit</p>
