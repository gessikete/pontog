<p style="text-align: center;">All my life I was<br />
Swinging for the fence<br />
I was looking for the triple<br />
Never playing good defense</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We were gunnin' for the glitter<br />
Every hot and heavy hitter<br />
She was never really there<br />
So I couldn't really get her</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Factually I--I'm just a piece of it<br />
Factually I--the very least of it</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Piece of work<br />
I was really quite a jerk<br />
Keeping score is such a bore<br />
A busy mind could go berserk<br />
Feast on this<br />
I was fishing for a hook<br />
So I took a little trip<br />
When I opened up the book</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Factually I--I'm just a piece of it<br />
Factually I--the very least of it<br />
Factually I--it's just the medicine<br />
Makes you wanna cry --why don't they let us in</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Be my wife<br />
I think you're right that we should mate<br />
Tell your friends<br />
I've got a factory of faith<br />
Late last night<br />
I had a dream that it was great<br />
Tell your friends<br />
I've got a factory of faith<br />
I've got a factory of</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Crack your whip<br />
She's confessing from the hip<br />
She was good at getting there<br />
But not as much for round trip</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">All this time<br />
I was searching for a dream<br />
I was slippin' in and out<br />
Of every other sex machine</p>
